# Colonist.io log parser
Chrome extention for [Colonist.io](https://colonist.io/) game.


## DISCLAIMER

#### Currently works for 1v1 without trade. Trade is private so count will loose track of cards.


## Description
Parses public log and displays data on charts. Also hides ads.

**Disclaimer 1**: Review Colonist supported version before using. Log UI and messages might change altering completely the count of resources. 

**Disclaimer 2**: Trade with Unknown Card [?] makes exact calculations imposible. Same when stealing cards between other players
