# Colonist.io 1v1 - log tracker
Chrome extention for [Colonist.io](https://colonist.io/) game.


## Description
Parses public log and displays data on charts. Also hides ads. 




**Disclaimer 1**: Review Colonist supported version before using. Log UI and messages might change altering completely the count of resources. 

**Disclaimer 2**: Trade with Unknown Card [?] makes exact calculations imposible. Same when stealing cards between other players
